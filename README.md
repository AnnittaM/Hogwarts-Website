    The sorting ceremony takes place at the beginning of each school year, where new students are
     sorted into Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin.

    The sorting is conducted by the Sorting Hat, a magical hat with a personality and the ability 
    to speak. The hat takes into account the traits, values, and potential of each student before 
    determining their house. Here is a brief description of each house:
    
    Gryffindor: Known for bravery, daring, and chivalry. Gryffindor students are often courageous 
    and willing to stand up for what is right.
    
    Hufflepuff: Known for loyalty, patience, and hard work. Hufflepuff students are often kind, 
    inclusive, and dedicated to their friends and tasks.
    
    Ravenclaw: Known for intelligence, wisdom, and wit. Ravenclaw students value knowledge and 
    learning and tend to be creative and logical thinkers.
    
    Slytherin: Known for ambition, cunning, and resourcefulness. 
    Slytherin students are often determined and willing to do whatever it takes to achieve their goals.

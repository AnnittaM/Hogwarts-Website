Description
The sorting ceremony takes place at the beginning of each school year, where new students are sorted into Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, or Slytherin. The sorting is conducted by the Sorting Hat, a magical hat with a personality and the ability to speak. The hat takes into account the traits, values, and potential of each student before determining their house.
